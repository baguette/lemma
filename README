Lemma is a Lisp dialect inspired by several other languages, the most obvious
ones being Scheme, Arc, and Clojure.  Lemma is also highly experimental and in
a constant state of change. Lemma is currently a work in progress and as such
is incomplete and inefficient.

The idea is to create a modern version of Lisp that integrates with the Lua
programming language.  Currently, there is a slow, ugly interpreter that
supports a handful of special forms, lexical scope, directly calling Lua
functions, and macros.  There is also some preliminary syntactic sugar for
dealing with Lua tables.

To reiterate: Lemma the language as well as lemma the interpreter are works
in progress.  The language is experimental while the interpreter provides a
playground for the experimentation.  The interpreter is also very slow.  My
plan is to continue modifying the interpreter until it accepts a language that
I'm satisfied with.  After the language becomes fairly stable, I plan to begin
work on a self-hosting compiler that targets the LVM.

Any file with the .lma extension in this repository is a Lemma source file.
There are quite a few located in the example/ directory, plus some macros
in lib/std.lma. Have a look if you're curious.

To use the interpreter, you need to have Lua installed (http://lua.org/).
It was developed with version 5.1 but might work with 5.2.
First, cd to the directory containing the Lemma source files.  Make sure
the lemma script is executable:

   $ chmod +x lemma

Then execute it:

   $ ./lemma                      # start a REPL
   $ ./lemma file.lma             # evaluate the contents of file.lma

To be able to execute from other directories, some environment variables
need to be set.  This depends on where lemma resides on your file system,
but it will typically be something along these lines:

   LEMMA_PATH=$HOME/Workspace/lemma
   PATH=$PATH:$LEMMA_PATH
   LUA_PATH="$LEMMA_PATH/?.lua;$LEMMA_PATH/?/?.lua;./?.lua;;"
   export LEMMA_PATH PATH LUA_PATH

That's all for now...
