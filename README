Lemma is a Lisp dialect inspired by Scheme and Clojure.  At the moment, Lemma
is also highly experimental and in a constant state of change.
Lemma is currently a work in progress and as such is incomplete and inefficient.

The idea is to create a modern version of Lisp that integrates with the Lua
programming language.  Currently, there is a slow, ugly interpreter that
supports a handful of special forms, lexical scope, directly calling
Lua functions, and macros.  There is also some preliminary syntactic sugar
for dealing with Lua tables.

While the interpreter supports a lot of features, it has even more limitations.
As stated, it's a work in progress.  The code is also rather disorganized
right now.

Any file with the .lma extension in this repository is a Lemma source file.
There are quite a few located in the example/ directory, plus some macros
in lib.lma. Have a look if you're curious.  More documentation is on the way.

To use the interpreter, you need to have Lua installed (http://lua.org/).
It was developed with version 5.1 but might work with 5.2.
First, cd to the directory containing the Lemma source files.  Make sure
the lemma script is executeable:

   $ chmod +x lemma

Then execute it:

   $ ./lemma                      # start a REPL
   $ ./lemma file.lma             # evaluate the contents of file.lma

That's all for now...
