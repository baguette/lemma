Besides the TODOs listed in comments:

- Fix bug where reader disregards nil and false literals.
  (Use lemma/del to set variables to nil as a workaround for that
   case. Seqs with holes are still not possible...).
- Add :use for ns macro
- fix Seqs -> only need first, rest, and seq
  (seq should return a Seq, not an empty whatever)
- (auto?) gensym
- destructuring
- multimethods
- protocols
- LemmaDoc
- Better error handling

Future:
- Self-hosting compiler!
